Maybe this paper outlines the new modelling framework as an example of our perspective on programming in the large vs programming in the small, then briefly covers the implementation of our workflow modelling framework as an example of it. Claim that a more thorough investigation of large vs small is forthcoming (being the actual paper on how we model workflows in the new framework).

That means that, here, we don't discuss ASP, AU, or PyDySoFu.
